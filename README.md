# AI Code Translator Readme

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into building the code translator, you've set up your development environment:

1. Installed Node.js to get your system ready for coding.
2. Set up a Node.js application.
3. Wrote code that utilizes the OpenAI API for text generation.
4. Gained an understanding of training the model using prompts.

### Front-End Development

With your environment ready, you started building the front-end of our application:

1. **Creating the UI**: You've crafted a user-friendly interface, including a code editor, language selector, scroll-down bar, and a code window for writing and editing code.
2. **Populating Languages**: You've curated a list of programming languages to populate the dropdown menu.
3. **Home Page Creation**: You've developed a welcoming home page using Next.js, making your application accessible to users.

### Back-End Development

After the front-end, you delved into prompt engineering and back-end development:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: You've mastered the art of crafting prompts that instruct the AI model effectively.
2. **Model Training**: You've learned how to train the model to provide accurate and useful code translations.
3. **Building the Back-End**: You've written the back-end code to handle requests and responses.
